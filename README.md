Hi, I'm Jumpei 👋  
I'm a software engineer at ZOZO, primarily working with Flutter.

I enjoy building products from scratch (0 → 1) and improving development environments.  
I'm especially interested in cross-platform development, IoT, developer productivity, and engineering organization management.

Previously, I developed an IoT product using Raspberry Pi Pico and BLE, which won a Special Jury Award at JPHACKS.  
I also enjoy sharing knowledge through tech talks and contributing to better team communication and workflows.

**Tech Interests & Skills**
- Flutter / Dart
